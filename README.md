Open Source implementation of GoldSrc engine  
Based on Reverse-engineered (and bugfixed) HLDS aka ReHLDS and Id Tech sources (+ Xash and Metahook)

For more information about the project you can visit it's official [Wiki](https://github.com/Sh1ft0x0EF/OpenGoldSrc/wiki)

Since no one from Valve Corp doesn't want to even touch the original GoldSrc the decision to write a
custom implementation of it was made  
OpenGoldSrc (or simply OGS) is a custom implementation of the original GoldSrc engine based on the source code that was
used to create the GS - licensed version of QuakeWorld engine developed by Id Software (@id-software)
OGS project isn't oriented on fully cloning the GoldSrc

## License

Licensed under GPLv3, see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details
Some of the code is originally written by Valve LLC and licensed under terms
of Valve license which not fully compatible with GPL because it doesn't allow to sell the product
This product is also not fully legal because it uses the sources that aren't
officialy open-sourced (sorry V) by Valve LLC (and won't be because they doesn't want even to touch the engine now)
The sources probably would be rewritten to new impl that will use the new C++ standards features to be more legal
This project isn't oriented on earning any commercial profit from it in any way
